## Custom Steam Art

This repository also includes custom Steam art that can be used in conjunction with the launcher, if you wish to add it to your Steam library.

There are two versions of the art: **old Hitman insignia** and **new Hitman insignia** ([as seen in HITMAN™ 3](https://hitman.fandom.com/wiki/Hitman_Insignia#HITMAN.E2.84.A2_III "hitman.fandom.com/wiki/Hitman_Insignia")).
